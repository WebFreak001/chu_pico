# Chu Pico Large - Chunithm Style Controller

This is a fork of whowechina's [Chu Pico](https://github.com/whowechina/chu_pico) project, which is a half-sized DIY controller for chunithm-style games.

**CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, BOARD HARDWARE NOT YET TESTED!**

Differences from upstream:

* 500x100 mm board with 460x82 touch (key) area instead of 233x52 touch area
* replaced capacitive touch sensors with SMD variants, put them all on back panel
* added a 4th capacitive touch sensor (4 keys = 8 regions each)
* added connections for IR towers on left and right side (simple soldering pads)

### Main

* 1x Rasberry Pico Pi Pico or Pico W.

  Becareful of 3 pins that are at the other side, they're difficult to solder and may leave air bubbles.

* 1x USB Type-C socket (918-418K2023S40001 or KH-TYPE-C-16P)
* 36x WS2812B-4020 side-facing RGB LEDs.

* 1x TCA9548APWR (TSSOP-24) I2C multiplexer.

* 4x MPR121 capacitive touch modules
* 5x Sharp GP2Y0E03 or ST VL53L0X ToF sensor modules, you need cables as well. Please note that the pictures are taken from upstream and depict the small controller.

   You can use both of them in a same PCB, the firmware will identify each of them automatically.

* 4x 0603 75kohm resistors (R14, R15, R16, R17; one next to each MPR121 module on backside)
* 2x 0603 5.1kohm resistors (R1, R2; next to USB port).
* 10x 0603 4.7kohm resistors (all the remaining resistors - value from schematic, upstream project calls for 5.1kohm in their README, so perhaps try these instead).
* 12x 0603 1uF (0.1~1uF all fine) capacitors (C1 to C12)
* 3x Panasonic EVQP46B3M tiny tactile switches.

### Air Tower

* 3x PT333-3B photo transistor (Q2, Q4, Q6)
* 3x IR333C-A infrared LED emitters (D1, D2, D3)
* 3x 2N7002 MOSFETs (60V 115mA 1.7Î©@5V,50mA 200mW 2.5V 1 N-channel SOT-23) OR AO3400A (unclear from schematic) (Q1, Q3, Q5)
* 2x 47uF D5xL5.4mm polarized capacitors (I picked RVT1A470M0505 47UF 10V, but don't know if this was right yet) (C1, C2)
* 3x 0603 1ohm resistors (R2, R4, R6)
* 3x 0603 10ohm resistors (R1, R3, R5)
* 3x 0603 2kohm resistors (R7, R8, R9)
* 1x 0603 10kohm resistors (R10)


### Light Guide Panel

I have not yet cut any light panel, but the raw cut plan for it is inside [`PCB/main/3dmodels/keypad_kicad.svg`](PCB/main/3dmodels/keypad_kicad.svg) (dimensions: 481x93 mm)

### Case

No case available yet, see PCB file for exact mounting hole positions

WIP case blender file in [Production/CAD/case_large.blend](Production/CAD/case_large.blend)

## Firmware

The firmware is not yet adjusted to the large version, but should work with the following changes:
- adjust key layout (MPR121 at address 0x5A has keys K1-K8, 0x5B has keys K9-K16, 0x5C has keys K17-K24, 0x5D has keys K25-K32)
- enable IR towers by default (optional)
